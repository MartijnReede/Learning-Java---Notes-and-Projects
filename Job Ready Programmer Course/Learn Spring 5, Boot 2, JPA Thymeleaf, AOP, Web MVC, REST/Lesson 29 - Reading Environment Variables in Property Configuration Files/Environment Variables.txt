In the previous lesson, we were reading values from the application.properties file. These values
were defined there. Sometimes we donÂ´t want to see what these property values are like usernames or 
passwords. We can do this by not defining them inside of the property file but in the environment. 

The version property will look like this then:
version=${envVersionNum}

Now we have to set the number of the version inside of the environment which is going to be used by our 
application. 

The developer won't have access to the properties now. In the video of this lesson, linux is used....
I have Windows so figuring out how this works is something for another time.

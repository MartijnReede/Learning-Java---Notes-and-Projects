Decoupling repositories is adds a layer of distraction. Why would we do this?
If we would move to another database, we only have to change our services instead
of all our controllers. This is good practice!

Instead of autowiring the repositories in the controllers, we create services that
we inject in our controllers. The repositories are injected in our services.

The service classes have an @Service annotation, so they will be part of the Spring context.

I've uploaded the project again with all the changes.

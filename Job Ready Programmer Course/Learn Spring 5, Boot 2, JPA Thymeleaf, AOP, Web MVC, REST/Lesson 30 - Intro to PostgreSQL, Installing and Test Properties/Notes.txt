For this lesson we want our application to work with a real database, not with our testing H2
database. 

First we start with creating a new application.properties file since our current properties are 
for developing and testing our application. We create a new file (just a normal file) and call it
application-test.properties. We copy all our properties in there. 

For this course we're going to work with PostgreSQL so I downloaded and installed the database
application.

We are installing 3 components:
- PostgreSQL sever (the actual database).
- pgAdmin 4 (User interface).
- Command Line Tools (allows us to use the command line to do things with the database).

the username for the databse will be "postgres"

To go to the UI we have to open pgAdmin 4 from the start menu. We've created a new database there called
pma-SpringBootDB. 

Now we have to connect our Spring application to this database. But to do this, we need a PostgreSQL
driver. We can add this simply by adding it as a dependency. We can copy paste it in our pom.xml file
or we can add the dependency using "Spring Add Starters".

Writing the correct settings to connect to the database will be discussed in the next lesson.

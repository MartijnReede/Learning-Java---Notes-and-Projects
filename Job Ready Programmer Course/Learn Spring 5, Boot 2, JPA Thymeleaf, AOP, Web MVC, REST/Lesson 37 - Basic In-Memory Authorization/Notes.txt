In the previous lesson, we've set up basic in-memory authentication. 
Again: authentication means, WHO is logging in.

Now we're going to talk about basic in-memory authorization. 
This means: Is the person who is logged in authorized to access certain parts of the software
and what is this person authorized to do...

@Override
Protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/projects/new").hasRole("ADMIN")
	.antMatchers("/").authenticated().and().formLogin();
}


So in the method above, we have set two different rules. 

1. Only admins can go to the projects/new endpoint and create new projects. 
2. Everyone else can access the home page, as long as they are authenticated with the form-login. 

Now to make the method more complete, I make the creation of new employees also available to only
admins.

I've added the complete class in this github folder.


NOT MENTIONED IN THE LESSON:
Save method to the repository didn't work anymore. Use this line of code to enable it. The application is less secure though....

http.csrf().disable();

Where do we store CSS, Javascript or image files? 

In the src --> recources -->static folder, we create new folders named CSS, JS or Images.
Here we store all those files. 

For this lesson we want to add a chart to our web application. We're getting this from www.chartjs.org
We can copy the JS code for the chart from there, but we also need to link to the code that is actually creating the chart.
For the chart we use in this lesson, we have to use this import: <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.8.0"></script>

We'll choose a pie chart for this lesson. And we copy the code from jschart.org to a new JS file in a JS folder 
in src-recourses. 

Make sure all of your javascript code is at the bottom of your html file. Javascript can take some time to load, so it is better
to load the rest first. 

To place the canvas on the web page, we have to create a canvas. Also we are referencing to the js file but the pie chart
does not show anything yet.

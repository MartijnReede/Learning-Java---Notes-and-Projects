------ APPLICATION PROPERTIES -------

An application can run in different environments. This means, we have to have different
properties for each environment. We don't want to hardcode properties inside of our Java classes, we
set properties in the application.properties file. It is possible that an application has multiple
different property files. 

So how can we read from the properties in our application. A good example is to create a property that
we created ourselves. We call this property "version".

If I set this propery inside of our application.properties file to:
version=1.0.0.0

We can read this property using the @Value annotation. For example, if we want to display the version
of this application on the home page. We go to the home controller and create a field there: 

@Value("${version})
private String ver;

Now ver wil have the value of "1.0.0.0".

We can use this "ver" variable in our views just like any other variable to display the version number
on the homepage.
